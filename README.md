# TableBuilder JS
Build beautiful and customizable HTML tables without writing a single line of code

## Overview
TableBuilder, an open-source jQuery plugin tool, allows users of any level to create beautiful searchable, sortable and responsive HTML tables. All you need is a Google Spreadsheet or Microsoft Excel CSV file to get started. From there, customize over thirty options to make your table display your data the best possible way. Add custom styles to integrate perfectly in any website. Best part is, you can do all this without knowing how to write a single line of code! 

## Getting Started
Head over to <a href="http://robkandel.github.io/tablebuilder/">http://robkandel.github.io/tablebuilder/</a> to start building your table or check out a demo in the easy to use editor. Once you finished building your table, click the save button to download your project (source files included) or copy and paste the embed code for quick publication. 

## Features
TableBuilder has over thirty customizable options that can be changed to fit your table. From formatting data, to changing column widths, to adding text blocks, every option is easy to modify without any code. You can also skin TableBuilder to seemless fit the styles of your website or overwrite all the styles with your own CSS.

## Compatibility
TableBuilder has been tested in and confirmed to work in the following browsers:
<ul>
	<li>Chrome</li>
	<li>Firefox</li>
	<li>Safari</li>
	<li>Internet Explorer 9/10/11</li>
	<li>Opera</li>
</ul>
TableBuilder's only dependency is jQuery. A version of jQuery will be provided if you download the your saved project but will not be included in the embed code provided. This is because jQuery is commonly included in most websites and therefore it avoids duplication.
